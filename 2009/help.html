<a name="searchtips"></a>
<h2 class="helpSubhead">Advanced Keyword Search Tips</h2>

<h3>Multiple Words</h3>
<p>When searching multiple words the system will automatically supply the Boolean &quot;and&quot; operator between each word; multiple words entered for the search will all occur somewhere in the retrieved records though not necessarily in the order entered. Both examples on the right will retrieve the same results.</p>

<div class="helpExample">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Using multiple words:<br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=university+science+department">university science department</a><br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=university+and+science+and+department">university and science and department</a>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Phrase Searches</h3>
<p>Search for complete phrases by enclosing them in quotation marks. Words enclosed in double quotes will appear together in all results exactly as typed.</p>

<div class="helpExample">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>A phrase Search:<br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=%22university+science+department%22">&quot;university science department&quot;</a>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Wildcards</h3>
<!--<p><strong>*</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The asterisk ('*') matches up to five non-space characters, starting at the specified position in the word. For example, &quot;inter*&quot; will match &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;internet&quot;, but will not match &quot;international&quot;. The '*' wildcard may only appear after at least two characters.</p>
<p>The '*' wildcard may also be embedded in a search string. For example, &quot;colo*r&quot; would match both &quot;color&quot; and &quot;colour&quot;.</p> -->
<p><strong>*</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matches any number of non-space characters, starting at the specified position in the word. For example, &quot;comput*&quot; will match all words that begin with &quot;comput&quot; (e.g., &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;computation&quot;, etc.).<br>The '*' wildcard may also be embedded in a search string.</p>
<p><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may use a question mark ('?') to replace a single character anywhere within a word.</p>

<div class="helpExample">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>* Wildcard:<br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=environment*+polic*">environment* polic*</a><br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=comp*">comp*</a>
</p>
<p>? Wildcard:</strong><br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=wom%3Fn">wom?n</a>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
<p>Use AND or OR to specify multiple words in any field, any order. Use AND NOT to exclude words. Select the operator you wish to use from the selection list on the Advanced Search form.</p>

<div class="helpExample">
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Using Boolean operators:<br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=stocks+and+bonds">stocks and bonds</a><br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=stocks+or+bonds">stocks or bonds</a><br>
<a href="/search/X?SEARCH=stocks+and+not+bonds">stocks and not bonds</a>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Field Limits</h3>
<p>Field limits may be specified by selecting a field limit from the selection list. These limits appear before the word or phrase to be searched. A field limit causes the system to search only the specified field for the specified word(s).</p>
<h4>Field Limits and their meanings:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Author: Search only author fields</li>
    <li>Title: Search only title fields</li>
    <li>Subject: Search only subject fields</li>
    <li>Note: Search only note fields</li>
    <li>Subject: Search only subject fields</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grouping</h3>
<p>Keyword search results are usually grouped by relevance to bring the most likely titles to the top of the list. Each group represents a similar level of relevance and results are sorted within the group by date or title. To get an ungrouped result set, use boolean operators to form a complex query.

<a name="rpro"></a>
<h2 class="helpSubhead">Research Pro</h2>
<p>Research Pro searches simultaneously across multiple databases, websites, and catalogs selected by the library to find full-text articles, abstracts, images, books, and other resources. Research Pro passes your search request to the target resources you select, so the search will be interpreted by each of the target resources. Research Pro will retrieve results from the resources you select - you can then see which resources have the most information relevant to your work. Research Pro is a useful way to get an overview of your subject and orient yourself to some of the resources available.</p>

<h3>Research Pro Search Tips</h3>
<p>By default, Research Pro performs a simple search across the default resources the library has selected for you. You can always select other groups of resources or individual resources to search.</p>

<p>Simple search queries are passed to each target resource exactly as they are typed in to retrieve results based on the default settings of each target database (e.g. searched as keywords or phrase), and results are displayed on a separate tab for each resource (e.g. sorted by relevance or date).  You can view results from each of the different databases simply by clicking on the database name in the tabs on the left side of the results page, or click the "All Resources" tab to view all results interfiled.</p>

<p>The Research Pro advanced search lets you combine up to 3 search terms from different search indexes using Boolean operators for more complex searches.</p>

<p>Combine your terms by selecting the Boolean operators AND, OR, or NOT using the radio buttons to the right of the search term boxes. You can change the way your search terms are nested using the "Construct Search As" options below the search term boxes.</p>

<p>Research Pro will send the search terms exactly as the user has typed them, so you can take advantage of any truncation and wildcard symbols supported by the target resources you have chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the truncation and wildcard symbols used vary from one database to another, so your search may be interpreted incorrectly by a resource that does not support the symbols you have included.
